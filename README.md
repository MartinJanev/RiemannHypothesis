# Riemann Hypothesis: Presentation & Documentation

This project offers a concise overview of the Riemann Hypothesis, exploring its impact on prime number distribution through a modified prime counting function and harmonic analysis.

## Overview

- **Modified Prime Counting Function:**  
  We weight primes (and their powers) by \( \log(x) \) to smooth the discrete jumps in the prime counting function.

- **Harmonic Analysis:**  
  Each non-trivial zero of the Riemann Zeta Function contributes a harmonic. The infinite sum of these harmonics exactly reproduces the modified prime counting function, linking the zero distribution to prime distribution.

- **Riemann Hypothesis:**  
  The hypothesis posits that all non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line \( \Re(s) = \frac{1}{2} \), which underpins our understanding of prime distribution.
